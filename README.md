# msc-debloating-java

This repository contains the artifacts for a Master's thesis project conducted in collaboration with Chalmers University of Technology. The project investigates the impact of Java debloating tools on software energy efficiency.

The repository includes:

- Source code and artifacts for all Systems Under Test (SUTs), including both benchmarks and real-world Java applications.
- A collection of Bash scripts to automate the generation of necessary files and execute the experimental pipeline on Linux systems.

**Note:** Some manual adjustments are required—particularly updating file paths in the scripts—to align with your local environment. However, the majority of the setup and execution process is automated.

**Estimated runtime:** Running the full set of experiments takes approximately **75 hours**.
